To Do:

readTree.py
	- make multiple ways to pick starting node. Currently relies on an exponential distribution to preferentially make moves on shorter branches. 
	- Do we need to store branch lengths? If processing time becomes an issue then delete these steps. 
	- Use characters to illustrate what the moves are doing. Lable with variables from code. 
		- >>> tree = Phylo.parse('phyloxml_examples.xml', 'phyloxml').next()
		- >>> Phylo.draw_ascii(tree)

subsampleTreeFile.py
	- switch from Dendropy to biopython if possible for reading in nexus files. Something faster.
